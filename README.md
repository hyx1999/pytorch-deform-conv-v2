# pytorch-deform-conv-v2
This repository contains code for **Deformable ConvNets v2 (Modulated Deformable Convolution)** based on [Deformable ConvNets v2: More Deformable, Better Results
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11168) implemented in PyTorch. This implementation of deformable convolution based on [4uiiurz1/pytorch-deform-conv-v2](https://github.com/4uiiurz1/pytorch-deform-conv-v2) and support group on the original basis, thanks to 4uiiurz1.

# TODO
 - [x] Support deformable group
